    <h3>Topic #1: House Plants</h3>
    <div class="box">
    <p>My first possible topic is “houseplants”! I chose this since I am very passionate about plants, and have collected around 20 different types since the beginning of the pandemic. I strongly believe in their healing qualities, and think it would be incredibly interesting to research and share different species and the various health benefits they offer! Potential topics for each section of the webpage could include information on the origination of house plants, different types of plants, how plants affect our mental and physical health, the rise of plant popularity in quarantine, and other lesser known fun facts about plants!</p>

    <h3>Topic #2: Gen-Z Fashion</h3>
    <div class="box">
    <p>My second possible topic covers Gen-Z fashion trends! I am an avid fan of fashion, and especially the new trends that Gen-Z have developed that continue to change the fashion
      industry as a whole. Social media has played a large role in the popularity of up and coming trends, and I think this development is very interesting! For instance, TikTok has aided the popularity of
      “Cottagecore”, “Y2K”, and “E-Girl” styles by inspiring teens and young adults worldwide. Potential topics for each section could include information about popular fashion trends, the rise of thrifting and upcycling, popular
      fashion brands, sustainable fashion, and rising models or designers.</p>

    <h3>Topic #3: The Rise of Asian Pop and Media</h3>
    <div class="box">
      <p>My third possible topic covers the rise of Asian Pop Music and Creative Media! I have been a fan of Asian media for nearly a decade, and am very passionate about it coming from an Asian background! Media like Korean pop, K-dramas, anime, and the like have skyrocketed in popularity in the past few years, but have been steadily rising over many years to bring forth this success. I think it would be interesting to analyze this timeline of popularity and which shows or musical artists most aided in this growth, especially over quarantine. Potential topics for each section could include information about the first instances of popular music genres like K-pop, groundbreaking shows that introduced Asian media to a global audience like Squid Game or Naruto, new and impressive achievements by Asian acts, the most popular musical artists and shows right now, and impact of this popularity on a global scale in terms of statistics and revenue.</p>
